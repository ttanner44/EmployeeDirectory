  ## Usage
  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
  
  ## User Story
  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. 
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. The user should be able to:  Sort the table by at least one category; Filter the users by at least one property.
